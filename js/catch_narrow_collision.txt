Make collisions stricter (harder to “auto-catch”)
Right now you’re using an AABB (axis‑aligned bounding box) overlap:
  return (
    px < bx + bw &&
    px + PLAYER_W > bx &&
    py < by + bh &&
    py + PLAYER_H > by
  );

Option A — Shrink both hitboxes by a uniform “inset” (fastest fix)
  Add tunable constants at the top of catch.js near your other size constants:
    // --- Collision tuning (lower = stricter) ---
    const PLAYER_HIT_INSET  = 10; // px trimmed on all sides of the boy
    const BALLOON_HIT_INSET = 10; // px trimmed on all sides of the balloon
  Then replace your collides(b) with this narrowed AABB:
    function collides(b) {
      // Player shrunken hitbox
      const pLeft   = playerX + PLAYER_HIT_INSET;
      const pRight  = playerX + PLAYER_W - PLAYER_HIT_INSET;
      const pTop    = (stage.clientHeight - PLAYER_H) + PLAYER_HIT_INSET;
      const pBottom = (stage.clientHeight - PLAYER_H) + PLAYER_H - PLAYER_HIT_INSET;
      // Balloon shrunken hitbox
      const bLeft   = b.x + BALLOON_HIT_INSET;
      const bRight  = b.x + BALLOON_W - BALLOON_HIT_INSET;
      const bTop    = b.y + BALLOON_HIT_INSET;
      const bBottom = b.y + BALLOON_H - BALLOON_HIT_INSET;
      // Overlap?
      return (pLeft < bRight && pRight > bLeft && pTop < bBottom && pBottom > bTop);
    }
Start with 10 px inset; if it’s still too generous, try 14–16 px. If it becomes too hard, reduce to 6–8 px.

Option B — Horizontal‑only catch (catch must be “under” the balloon)
Make it count only when the balloon is just above the boy and within a narrow horizontal lane. This feels very “basket‑catch” and avoids side‑snaps.
  // Tunables (add near your constants)
  const H_LANE_FACTOR   = 0.6;  // 0..1 of player width (smaller = stricter horizontal)
  const V_CATCH_WINDOW  = 12;   // px window above the player's head where a catch is valid
  function collides(b) {
    // Horizontal center alignment
    const playerCenter = playerX + PLAYER_W / 2;
    const balloonCenter = b.x + BALLOON_W / 2;
    const halfLane = (PLAYER_W * H_LANE_FACTOR) / 2;
    const horizontalAligned =
      balloonCenter >= (playerCenter - halfLane) &&
      balloonCenter <= (playerCenter + halfLane);
    // Vertical window: balloon bottom lies within a small band above player top
    const playerTop = stage.clientHeight - PLAYER_H;
    const balloonBottom = b.y + BALLOON_H;
    const verticalAligned =
      (balloonBottom >= playerTop - V_CATCH_WINDOW) &&
      (balloonBottom <= playerTop + 2); // allow tiny overlap
    return horizontalAligned && verticalAligned;
  }
Reduce H_LANE_FACTOR to 0.5 or 0.4 to force better alignment.
Reduce V_CATCH_WINDOW to 8–10 px for a tighter timing window.

Option C — Circle‑vs‑circle hit (nice for round balloons)
If your art is circular, compute overlap using centers and radii:
  // Tunables
  const PLAYER_RADIUS  = Math.min(PLAYER_W, PLAYER_H) * 0.35; // shrink visually
  const BALLOON_RADIUS = Math.min(BALLOON_W, BALLOON_H) * 0.35;
  function collides(b) {
    const playerCx = playerX + PLAYER_W / 2;
    const playerCy = (stage.clientHeight - PLAYER_H) + PLAYER_H / 2;
    const balloonCx = b.x + BALLOON_W / 2;
    const balloonCy = b.y + BALLOON_H / 2;
    const dx = playerCx - balloonCx;
    const dy = playerCy - balloonCy;
    const distSq = dx*dx + dy*dy;
    const r = PLAYER_RADIUS + BALLOON_RADIUS;
    return distSq <= r*r;
  }

Scoring:
  Base points per correct catch: 50
  Combo bonus: +10 per streak step, capped at +50
  
  1st correct in streak: 50 (+0)
  2nd: 60 (+10)
  3rd: 70 (+20)
  … up to a maximum of 100 for a long streak
  
  
  Wrong catch: −10 and combo reset to 0
  Correct counter (correct) increments only on correct catches.
  On finish, we:
  
  stop the timer, compute totalMs
  update highscore if score > previous
  write a leaderboard entry { score, right: correct, ms: totalMs }


const BASE_POINTS       = 40; // default 50
const COMBO_STEP        = 8;  // default 10
const COMBO_MAX_BONUS   = 40; // default 50 (so max per catch is BASE_POINTS + COMBO_MAX_BONUS)
const WRONG_PENALTY     = 15; // default 10
const pts = BASE_POINTS + Math.min(COMBO_MAX_BONUS, COMBO_STEP * (combo - 1));
